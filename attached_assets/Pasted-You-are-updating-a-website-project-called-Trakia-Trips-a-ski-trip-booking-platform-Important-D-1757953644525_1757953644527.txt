You are updating a website project called Trakia Trips, a ski trip booking platform.
⚠️ Important: Do not change the existing theme, design style, fonts, colors, or glass/abstract elements. Keep the design intact and just apply the changes below.
The site must be fully mobile responsive (proportionate to phone/tablet/desktop).

🔹 1. Package & Pricing Updates

Change “Weekend Package” → “2 Day Deal” with price 185€.

Change “Extended Package” → “Full Weekend Package” with price 245€.

Under packages, add: “Airport transfers available (not included).”

Both packages should clearly show:

4-star hotel (Breakfast + Dinner included).

Bus transport from Stara Zagora.

Club events with Afrobeats & House DJs.

Add visible note: “This does not include flights or ski pass.”

Payment must support installments:

Deposit now.

Remainder due 6th January.

🔹 2. Section & Text Changes

Change headings:

“What’s Included” → “Our Package Includes.”

“Adventurers” → “Bookings.”

“Experiences” → “Experience.”

Change date format everywhere to: “6th–9th of March.”

Remove any specific numbers (like 500+ travelers). Instead, say: “Limited Places.”

Change “Squad Adventures” → “Group Adventures.”

In “Not included” section, add:

“Whatever is not mentioned under the included section.” (legal protection).

Update copy to: “Discounted rates on ski rentals.”

🔹 3. Booking Flow & Add-ons

Ski Rentals: allow customer to choose per day (number of rental days).

Snowboards: must be a separate option with its own price.

Airport Transfers:

Ask for flight number.

If flight not booked yet, allow editing later through profile/dashboard.

Rooms/Guests:

Options: double rooms, 3-person apartments, 5-person apartments.

Support up to 15 guests per booking.

Collect for each guest: Full Name, Date of Birth, Phone Number.

Evening Events: set price to 0 (free), but still allow booking (so organizers can track numbers).

Add “Book Now” buttons under package cards and images.

🔹 4. Transport

Replace all mentions of “VIP Transport” with “Private Transport.”

🔹 5. Payment Integration (Fondy)

Integrate Fondy Hosted Checkout instead of Stripe.

Flow:

User clicks Purchase.

Redirect to Fondy Checkout page.

After payment → redirect to /success or /failed.

Fondy also sends a webhook POST to /webhook on the backend.

Backend verifies payment using Merchant ID + Secret Key (I will provide later).

Backend updates booking status in DB.

Do not hardcode keys. Use env variables:

process.env.FONDY_MERCHANT_ID

process.env.FONDY_SECRET_KEY

🔹 6. Profile Dashboard (New Feature)

Add Profile icon (top right corner).

When user logs in, they should see a dashboard with:

Packages they purchased.

Booking details (dates, room type, extras).

All guest details they entered.

Options to add more guests or edit existing info.

Option to update flight number if not provided earlier.

Profile must match the site’s design theme and be mobile-friendly.

🔹 7. Technical Requirements

Backend: Node.js with Express.

Required routes:

/success → thank you page.

/failed → payment failed page.

/webhook → Fondy webhook verification + booking update.

Database: Supabase (or local DB) for storing bookings, guests, payments.

Gallery section: must support horizontal scrolling with loop, showing images and videos (I will provide media).

Must remain mobile optimized and theme consistent.

👉 Final output:

Updated frontend with all changes applied.

Backend with Fondy integration placeholders.

User profile/dashboard fully functional.

Booking flow supports multiple guests, add-ons, and installments.

Mobile optimized UI, no broken layouts.
