# Current Work Status - Trakia Trips Migration

## ‚úÖ FIXED - Booking Creation Error
~~**Error when creating booking:**~~
~~```~~
~~Error saving booking: ~~
~~Object {code: "23502", details: "Failing row contains (032da492-90d1-46a5-bed0-3a70e2041e44, test@gmail.com, Full Weekend Package,‚Ä¶", hint: null, message: "null value in column "package_price" of relation "bookings" violates not-null constraint"}~~
~~```~~

~~**Root Cause:** BookingFlow.tsx is missing `package_price` field when inserting booking record. Database schema requires it but our insert statement doesn't include it.~~

**‚úÖ FIXED:** Added `package_price: selectedPackage?.price.toString() || '0'` to the booking insert in BookingFlow.tsx line 258.

## Migration Project Status

### What We're Working On
- Migrating Trakia Trips ski booking platform from Replit Agent to Replit environment
- Fixing database schema mismatches between Drizzle schema and application code

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS
1. ‚úÖ Installed required packages (npm install successful)
2. ‚úÖ Fixed missing API secrets (Stripe & Supabase keys added)
3. ‚úÖ Fixed AdminDashboard database query column mismatches (`lead_email` ‚Üí `user_email`)
4. ‚úÖ Updated Supabase types to match actual Drizzle schema
5. ‚úÖ Updated BookingFlow to use correct schema fields (mostly)
6. ‚úÖ Fixed AdminDashboard to get lead info from guests table join
7. ‚úÖ Application is running on port 5000 without SQL errors
8. ‚úÖ Fixed booking creation error - added missing package_price field to BookingFlow.tsx
9. ‚úÖ **MAJOR FIX:** Fixed booking creation architecture - changed from direct Supabase calls to server API calls with correct field naming (camelCase vs snake_case)

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS TASKS
- ‚úÖ Testing booking creation flow (architectural fix completed)
- Verifying dashboard shows "Confirmed" status after Stripe payment

### ‚ùå PENDING TASKS
1. Test complete booking‚Üípayment‚Üídashboard flow
2. Fix security: replace hardcoded admin password "MO1345" with server-side auth  
3. Complete migration checklist in `.local/state/replit/agent/progress_tracker.md`

### Key Files Modified
- `client/src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Fixed database queries
- `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Updated type definitions
- `client/src/components/BookingFlow.tsx` - Partially updated schema (needs package_price fix)

### Technical Notes
- Payment status flow: Stripe webhook ‚Üí `paymentStatus: 'paid'` ‚Üí Dashboard shows "Confirmed"
- Schema source of truth: `shared/schema.ts` (Drizzle)
- Database has: `user_email`, `payment_status`, `package_price` (required)
- Test lead `test@gmail.com` exists in database and displays in dashboard

### Next Actions When Returning
1. **URGENT:** Fix BookingFlow.tsx package_price issue
2. Test complete booking flow
3. Address security hardcoded password
4. Complete migration
